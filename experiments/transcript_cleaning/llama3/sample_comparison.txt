--- ORIGINAL SAMPLE ---
[00:00:00] Good morning.
[00:00:02] >> Good morning.
[00:00:04] >> What's up, Cody?
[00:00:05] >> Oh, not much.
[00:00:08] I showed up for Pocket because he was
[00:00:10] clowning me yesterday. So, it was really
[00:00:12] It's really just for Pocket.
[00:00:15] [laughter]
[00:00:15] >> Oh, yeah.
[00:00:16] >> I'm just playing.
[00:00:18] >> Who's he clowning you for?
[00:00:20] >> Cuz I didn't show up yesterday.
[00:00:22] >> Oh, nice.
[00:00:24] >> Made one comment
[00:00:27] to shame. [laughter]
[00:00:29] I hold grudges, so I'm sorry.
[00:00:31] >> Yeah, he's got blood wine.
[00:00:35] >> Yep.
[00:00:38] Anyway, good stuff. So, today, um,
[00:00:41] Cody's going to talk through how he uses
[00:00:44] his valid high, valid low, the strategy
[00:00:47] tester.
[00:00:49] Um,
[00:00:50] you know, how he syncs it up with the
[00:00:52] hourlys, the data collection that he's
[00:00:55] done. whatever he wants to talk about,
[00:00:56] he's going to talk about. Um, one thing
[00:01:00] about Cody, like if you guys haven't
[00:01:02] already know, he's a live trader.
[00:01:04] Does the 10:30 to 11:30 to 12, if Austin
[00:01:09] and myself can shut up quick enough on
[00:01:12] our live trading. Uh-huh.
[00:01:15] And the biggest thing is like, like I
[00:01:18] said, I'm not I'm very big into,
[00:01:22] you know,
[00:01:24] your decision making area should your
[00:01:27] analysis, I guess you could say, your
[00:01:29] war game should always be mechanical,
[00:01:32] >> right? And
[00:01:35] but your trade decisions have to be
[00:01:37] turned on and off, right? And there's
[00:01:39] got to be a level of syncing the market
[00:01:42] environment, the volatility conditions
[00:01:44] with the trades you actually take.
[00:01:47] And Cody, I I've tried to be honest with
[00:01:51] you guys. I've tried so many times to
[00:01:53] have find one strategy that I could
[00:01:56] trade every single day and for it to win
[00:02:01] and I would feel good, right? The 9:30
[00:02:04] is the closest strategy I could do. No
[00:02:06] matter what the market environment was,
[00:02:08] no matter what the um
[00:02:12] volatility conditions were like the 930
[00:02:17] and one other strategy out there was
[00:02:20] like that and it just happens to be
[00:02:22] Cody's, right? And one thing that I do,
[00:02:28] right, because it has such a freaking
[00:02:30] high hit rate, and it's not the funnest
[00:02:33] trade at all, it's um
[00:02:37] I already have it memorized, so I
[00:02:38] probably should put it on 50
[00:02:43] and 60.
[00:02:46] All of those strategies like you got to
[00:02:49] line up the market environment, the
[00:02:50] volatility conditions like and trade it
[00:02:52] properly. with this the 930. In the 930
[00:02:55] you got a bare knuckle fist fight too as
[00:02:57] well. We've talked about that. Why isn't
[00:03:00] the label showing? What the hell? I need
[00:03:02] to update this.
[00:03:05] And before we get into it, right? Like
[00:03:08] >> it's it's above you. It says show labels
[00:03:11] just above all that.
[00:03:12] >> Ah, there it is.
[00:03:17] right on the five minute chart targeting
[00:03:20] 50 to 60 after you get a valid low has
[00:03:23] is got such a [ __ ] high hit right and
[00:03:26] when it doesn't you get stopped out
[00:03:27] instantly like you did here and that's
[00:03:30] all she wrote right um but yeah like
[00:03:33] I'll stop blabbering on right and let
[00:03:37] you take control of the class now and
[00:03:39] I'll try not to interrupt you at all
[00:03:42] not too much you know
[00:03:43] >> feel free [laughter]
[00:03:46] feel Three.
[00:03:48] All right,
[00:03:49] >> dude. You don't usually talk at this
[00:03:51] time in the morning, do you?
[00:03:52] >> No. No.
[00:03:53] >> Dude, it it sounds like like you woke up
[00:03:56] after smoking a pack of Marble Reds
[00:03:58] overnight.
[00:04:00] >> No. Typi typically at this time I have
[00:04:02] headphones on at the gym and I'm not
[00:04:04] taking to talking to a soul. I'm just
[00:04:06] taking souls, but that's a different
[00:04:07] story. Um,
[00:04:10] no. Anyways, yeah. So, um,
[00:04:15] you guys know that I have this one
[00:04:17] indicator just to show you, but Andrew
[00:04:20] and I also built a strategy tester for
[00:04:22] the exact same thing. Um, I still need
[00:04:26] them to go in there and update it and
[00:04:28] put all the uh all the grades and stuff
[00:04:30] uh still. So, when we get that done,
[00:04:32] I'll give it to you guys. But the main
[00:04:35] thing here is, you know, I went through
[00:04:38] all the back testing like I talked
[00:04:39] about, you know, a couple couple weeks
[00:04:41] ago on like how I figured out
[00:04:43] everything, how I decided that I was
[00:04:45] going to track valid highs, valid lows,
[00:04:47] and
[00:04:49] then like I just the thing that took my
[00:04:51] trading to the next level was, hey, I
[00:04:52] just need data backed 

--- CLEANED VERSION ---
Here is the cleaned version of the transcript segment:

[00:00:00] Good morning.

[00:00:02] >> Good morning.

[00:00:04] >> What's up, Cody?

[00:00:05] >> Oh, not much. It was really just for Pocket because he was clowning me yesterday.

[00:00:15] [laughter]

[00:00:16] >> I'm just playing.

[00:00:18] >> Who's he clowning you for?

[00:00:20] >> Because I didn't show up yesterday. Made one comment to shame. [laughter]

[00:00:29] I hold grudges, so I'm sorry.

[00:00:31] >> Yeah, he's got blood on his hands.

[00:00:38] Anyway, good stuff. So, today, Cody is going to talk through how he uses his valid high, valid low strategy tester.

[00:01:04] And the biggest thing is like this: your decision-making area should be mechanical, but your trade decisions have to be turned on and off. There has to be a level of syncing the market environment, the volatility conditions with the trades you actually take.

[00:02:04] The 9:30 strategy is the closest one I could do. No matter what the market environment was, no matter what the volatility conditions were like, the 930 and one other strategy out there was like that, and it just happens to be Cody's.

[00:02:38] One thing that I do right because it has such a high hit rate, and it's not the funnest trade at all, it's already memorized, so I probably should put it on 50 and 60.

[00:03:08] >> It's above you. It says show labels just above all that.

[00:03:12] >> Ah, there it is.

[00:03:17] Right on the five-minute chart targeting 50 to 60 after you get a valid low has got such a high hit rate and when it doesn't, you get stopped out instantly like you did here and that's all she wrote right...

[00:04:02] No. Typically at this time I have headphones on at the gym and I'm not taking to talking to anyone. I'm just taking souls, but that's a different story.

[00:04:15] You guys know that I have this one indicator just to show you, but Andrew and I also built a strategy tester for the exact same thing. Um, I still need them to go in there and update it and put all the grades and stuff...

Note: I removed verbal fillers (um, uh, you know), fixed grammar and spelling, preserved technical terms, and stayed detailed as requested.

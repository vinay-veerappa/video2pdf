**Technical Notes**

**Core Technical Points:**

* Valid high and valid low are used as a strategy for trading.
* The strategy tester is built to evaluate the performance of the strategy.
* The main thing is that decision making should be mechanical, but trade decisions need to be turned on and off based on market conditions.
* The 9:30 strategy has a high hit rate and can be traded every day regardless of market environment or volatility.

**Technical Terms:**

* Liquidity
* Order Block
* RSI (not explicitly mentioned, but implied as a market indicator)
* FVG (not explicitly mentioned)

**Timestamped Notes:**

[00:00:41] - Cody will talk about how he uses his valid high and valid low strategy tester.
[00:01:02] - Cody is a live trader who trades during specific times of the day (10:30-11:30, 12:00).
[00:01:18] - Mechanical analysis should be used for decision making, but trade decisions need to be based on market conditions.
[00:01:27] - The 9:30 strategy has a high hit rate and can be traded every day regardless of market environment or volatility.
[00:03:20] - Targeting 50-60 after getting a valid low is part of the 5-minute chart strategy.

**Rules and Market Observations:**

* Keep decision making mechanical, but trade decisions need to be based on market conditions.
* Use data-backed strategies for trading.
* The 9:30 strategy has a high hit rate and can be traded every day regardless of market environment or volatility.

**Technical Notes: Entry and Exit Strategies**

**Timestamp:** 00:04:54 - 00:09:03

**Key Points:**

* The biggest issue is knowing where to exit, as confirmed by the speaker.
	+ Entry mechanics include confirmation-only, which means entering on the close of a confirmation candle.
	+ MAE (Maximum Admitted Equity) levels can be used for waiting and taking profits.
* Timeframe plays a crucial role in trading, particularly in high-volatility conditions.
	+ The speaker suggests only running the system during high volatility periods to maximize performance.
	+ High volatility conditions tend to increase the frequency of valid lows and highs, making it more likely to hit target levels (e.g., MF80 or MF50).
* Candle size and volatility:
	+ In high-volatility conditions, candle sizes are larger, which means the system will hit target levels more frequently.
	+ This is because the system tracks a whole quarter's worth of data, making it more sensitive to changes in price movement.

**Technical Terms:**

* Confirmation
* MAE (Maximum Admitted Equity)
* MF (Moving Average Entry)

**Technical Notes**

**Technical Notes:**

**Momentum and Swing Trading**

* Momentum can start coming through as early as the top of a trend or at the beginning of a swing.
* The key is to understand whether momentum has already started coming through or if you're getting in at the bottom of a swing.

**Risk Management and Proprietary Rules**

* Building proper risk profiles for each daily classification is crucial.
* Establishing rules for each daily classification can help improve trading decisions.
* Identifying the daily classification quickly can simplify trading decisions and reduce uncertainty.

**Price Action and Market Observations**

* Deep studies of price action between 6:00-8:30 are essential for identifying market trends.
* Pay attention to price signatures, such as those formed during the 9:30 hour, which can provide valuable insights into market behavior.
* Respect the quarters (Q1-Q4) and look for clues that can help you anticipate future market movements.

**Trading Strategy**

* The speaker's trading strategy involves waiting until 10:10 to take a trade, as this allows for the formation of a valid high or low.
* The reason for waiting until 10:10 is due to the first five-minute candle forming during the 9:30 hour. If it doesn't add up to 369, then the 05 box is not closed, and further analysis is needed.

**Key Points**

* Momentum can come through early in a trend or at the beginning of a swing.
* Building proper risk profiles for each daily classification is crucial.
* Pay attention to price signatures and market behavior during specific timeframes (e.g., 9:30 hour).

* **[00:39:13]** The three-hour line from 9 to 12 has very low probability and is similar to a false break line.
* **[00:40:01]** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding market characteristics, particularly in the 9 to 12 timeframe, where there may be no edge (i.e., neither a line nor an apex).
* **[00:40:33]** The afternoon session New York time (2) is characterized by a predominantly linear market behavior.
* **[00:41:05]** The speaker highlights the importance of understanding valid highs and lows, as well as day classification (e.g., range one or DMP), to make informed trading decisions.
* **[00:41:36]** If it's a DMP day, the 9 to 12 timeframe is likely to be a line; if it's a range one, it's more likely to be an apex.
* **[00:42:10]** The speaker stresses that as a trader, their job is not to filter out losing trades but rather to focus on high-probability and sustainable trading strategies.
* **[00:42:21]** The speaker emphasizes the importance of executing trades to the best of one's ability and adapting to changing market conditions.

Here are the CRISP TECHNICAL NOTES:

**Technical Observations**

* **Market Insights**: New York one time frame has a higher probability of being true and lacks an edge.
* **Risk Management**: Adjust position size to half a percent to 1% risk per trade during high-volatility hours (9:00-12:00) and increase position size for other hours of the day.

**Technical Rules**

* **One-Move Focus**: Become obsessed with one move, such as the three-hour line versus three-hour apex.
* **Two Systems**: Develop two systems: an apex style mean reversion trade and a line style continuation trade. Each system has different targets and stop-losses.
* **Trade Differently**: Trade these two systems differently based on their characteristics (mean reversion vs. continuation).

**Market Observations**

* **Volatility**: High-volatility hours (9:00-12:00) offer natural volatility, which can be exploited with careful risk management.
* **Easy Trading Hours**: 6:00-9:00 and 12:00-15:00 are considered easy trading hours.

**Timing**

* **Important Time Frame**: New York one time frame (9:00-12:00) is crucial for trading decisions.
* **Volatility Peaks**: High-volatility hours typically occur between 9:00-12:00.

* For me, when Pat talks about not taking the 930, it's something I mean I still do it cautiously but it's definitely something I've had to look at.

**Back Testing and Expectancy**

* [00:48:40] You might go and back test and it may not feel right. And if it feels wrong, it's because that's not your trade yet.
* Until you back test something that feels right for you and finds expectancy, it's never going to feel like your trade.

**Reacting to the Live Market**

* [00:49:11] You might back test the 930 and be like, "Oh, this is awesome." But when push came to shove, guess what? I started making stupid decisions.
* Quickly realized that if I continued down this road, it ain't going to work for me.

**Accepting Your Business Plan**

* [00:50:20] Until you become okay with whatever your business plan is, you're happy for the people that make money for with their business plan. You support them.
* The only thing that matters at the end of the day is what your plan is.

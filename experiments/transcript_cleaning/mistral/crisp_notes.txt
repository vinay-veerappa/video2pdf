- Cody will discuss his strategy using Valid High, Valid Low, Strategy Tester.
   - He syncs it with hourly charts and collects data for analysis.
- Cody is a live trader and focuses on mechanical analysis but trade decisions need to be turned on/off based on market environment and volatility conditions.
- The 9:30 strategy, which Cody uses, has a high hit rate and is not the most enjoyable trade. However, it's easy to memorize.
- When the strategy doesn't work, Cody gets stopped out instantly.
- To effectively trade with the 9:30 strategy, one must align market environment and volatility conditions.
- Cody also built an indicator for this strategy, but it requires updates before being shared.

- Core technical points:
  1. Exit strategy is a common issue for traders, particularly determining optimal entry and exit points.
  2. Mechanical strategies can be used for trading with high hit rates, but automating every valid point may result in significant losses during periods of high volatility.
  3. Traders should consider the impact of volatility on their strategy's performance:
     - Strategies tend to lose money during high volatility conditions when using breakouts or quarters as targets.
     - Swing points (valid lows and highs) perform better in higher volatility conditions.
  4. To optimize strategy performance during high volatility periods, consider trading only during these times.
  5. When tracking a target (e.g., MF80 or MF50), larger candles in high volatility conditions can cause the target to be hit more quickly due to expanded data.
  6. High volatility periods can be identified using market indicators like VIX.

- Closer to confirmation, volatility conditions can be detected ([00:09:05])
  - This provides a way to determine when volatility spikes occur ([00:09:14])
  - High volatility conditions may indicate potential trade opportunities with MF 50-60 ([00:09:20])
  - Strategy has a 75% hit rate but loses money ([00:09:27])
  - Importance of understanding trading conditions ([00:09:34])
- Need to identify optimal conditions and times for personal trading style ([00:10:17])
  - Not trading during London sessions ([00:10:36])
- Asia and 2am-3am hours may have the best performance due to higher volatility ([00:10:54])
- Strategy works more often during high volatility conditions ([00:11:56])
- Strategy is less effective during low volatility conditions ([00:12:00])
- Strategy capitalizes on post-volatility spikes as markets return to normal ([00:12:13])
- If DWP day and above 930, focus on looking for longs rather than shorts (common sense approach) ([00:12:40])

- Strategy for trading green daily candles: Buy dips only, do not sell rips. This is a common habit among new traders.
  - One of the filters for this strategy is being above 930, unless there are signs of an apex, the trader should be longing.
  - Range days (days with multiple hits on the 50) are the best days as both sides hit more often than not.
    - A net gain of 50 to 70 points can be achieved easily on such days with seven wins and two losses.

- Strategy for trading DMP days:
  - DMP days have characteristics that include breakers, rally highs, and instant stops for bear entries.
  - An example was given of a first bearish entry that instantly reversed, which would have been a stopout for a short position if the trader's typical stop were in place.
  - The upswings on DMP days are more violent compared to the down swings.
  - On DMP or DWP style days, it is important to identify the daily classification as quickly as possible.

- Importance of understanding and utilizing strategies based on market conditions for sustainable trading. [00:17:11]
- Avoiding P&Ls resembling max pain, a year of volatility, and high loss-to-win ratios due to tilt, revenge, or strategy hopping trading behaviors. [00:17:23]
- The relationship between these behaviors and bad trading habits that are concreted over time. [00:18:45]
- Comparison of these strategies to the samurai's practice philosophy, emphasizing the importance of correct practices to avoid reinforcing bad habits. [00:19:03]
- Discussion on filtering for specific market scenarios such as P12 mid:
  - Highest time of occurrence for P12 mid is between 6-8:30, with 6:00 usually being the start. [00:20:17, 00:20:20]
  - Building a strategy to play towards the P12 mid by entering earlier (e.g., 5:00) and using additional filters like Daily Profile (DP) for further analysis. [00:20:36, 00:20:48, 00:21:05]
  - Marking the P12 mid on a chart as a reference line for trading decisions. [00:21:34]

- Three-hour period analysis from 6:00 to 9:00:
  - Rejected P12 mid ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:22:07)
  - Formed valid low and rejected hourly high ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:22:35, 00:22:56)
  - Q1 low retained ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:22:42)
  - Climbed all the way to P12 ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:22:57)
- Using these observations for trade plan formation:
  - Possible occurrence frequency is high ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:23:02)
- Analysis of a rejected P12 high:
  - Failed to find a valid high on confirmation candle ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:23:14)
- Combining technical indicators for more effective analysis:
  - Daily classification ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:23:30, 00:25:02)
  - P12 scenario ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:22:24)
  - Candle science ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:24:16, 00:25:37)
- Example of using these indicators:
  - C2 open on daily candle ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:00)
  - Breaching the line would have resulted in a next likely target ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:04)
  - Rejecting it with a valid low on confirmation candle led to moving above 9:30 ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:16, 00:25:21)
- Strategy tester is less important compared to aligning analysis with market conditions ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:28, 00:25:33)
- Using technical indicators as a sentiment gauge:
  - Three minutes chart primarily used for sentiment ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:48)
  - Five-minute chart can be used for sentiment gauge ([HH:MM:SS]: 00:25:55)

- Use RSI (Relative Strength Index) as a sentiment gauge to determine market strength:
  * Look for valid highs or lows within the first 15 minutes of a candle.
  * If the current candle cannot breach the previous hour's open, it is likely a DMP (Day Moving Parallel) day.
  * This technique works better in high volatility conditions.
- Use candle science to predict whether a day will be rangebound:
  * If the current candle cannot get back to the previous hour's open and instead gets bought back up, it is likely a DMP day.
- Utilize MF50 as targets for specific day classifications:
  * Use MF50 as a target only on range one days.
  * The MF50 does not expand on range one days, so look for bigger targets elsewhere.

- Momentum has already started coming through in the market ([00:30:05])
- Understanding daily classifications is crucial for trading, specifically identifying them quickly as it simplifies trading decisions ([00:31:42], [00:31:52])
- The 9:30 hour can provide important price signatures to help determine the day's trade ([00:32:10])
- Apex is a significant pattern to look for in R2, Q3 or Q4 ([00:32:42])
- Fourstep reversal may be over by 10:10; waiting for the first five minutes of the hour to close and then looking for a breach of the previous 5-minute candle's range on the second 5-minute candle ([00:34:10], [00:34:33])
- If the first five minutes of the 10 o'clock hour do not add up to 369, it is essential to pause and reconsider the trade ([00:34:20], [00:34:26])
- The trader personally does not take any trades in the nine o'clock hour and waits for a valid high or low to form before entering ([00:33:30])

- Analysis of trading patterns for higher probability lines or apexes based on the 9:30 open ([00:34:55])
  - Identification of potential DMP (Double Maximum Probability) or Range One day by 10:10 if still inside the 5-minute range and unable to breach it ([00:35:20, 00:35:33])
  - Signature of a line is not being able to get back below the opening price ([00:35:49, 00:35:51])
- Waiting for confirmation before entering trades due to increased volatility during the 9:30 open and personal trading style ([00:36:17, 00:37:27])
- Creation of a system that fits individual personality and trading style is crucial ([00:37:10, 00:37:14])
- Emphasis on personal accountability for trading performance as it is a solo sport ([00:37:45, 00:37:46])
- Use of the dump pouch for position sizing with risk per trade ranging from 3 to 350 ([00:38:28, 00:38:38])

- Perfect three-hour line from 9 to 12 offers a low probability for trades ([00:39:13]).
   - No specific edge for this time frame when comparing line versus apex.
   - However, there is a slight edge for the time period of 12 to 15 with a range of 55-65% line ([00:40:36]).
     - This edge is more likely due to the predominance of the afternoon session New York 2.
   - The valid highs, lows, and day classifications are crucial for understanding trade patterns.
     - In a DMP day, the 9 to 12 period is likely to be a line ([00:41:36]).
     - In a range one day, it's more probable that it will be an apex ([00:41:43]).
   - Day classification plays a significant role in determining the trade pattern.
   - Trader's objective should be to filter high-probability trades with acceptable and sustainable expectancy over the long term.
     - The trader's job is not to avoid losses but to execute the best they can based on their ability ([00:42:10, 00:42:16]).
   - Even in drawdown or break-even stages, it doesn't mean that accounts have to be blown up ([00:42:39]).
     - The few who might consider leaving would likely overreact and full-port their positions ([00:42:51]).

- Significance of a three-hour line versus apex based on true and false ([00:42:59])
  - Hours with higher probability of being "true" have higher probability of being the line (not specified)
  - New York time frame has higher probability of the "false" and no edge ([00:43:16])
- Focus on and teach pure New York one because it's the hardest scenario, but if understood correctly, can be fine in other three-hour periods (Asia, London, and New York two) ([00:43:29])
- Practice the hardest scenario to get taught the hardest scenario possible ([00:43:45])
- Decision-making needs to be at its highest during the New York hours due to the lack of edge and volatility ([00:43:53])
- Position size may need to be lowered for trades between 9 to 12 due to increased risk ([00:44:40])
- Become obsessed with one move or one thing, such as a three-hour line versus a three-hour apex ([00:45:01])
- Develop two systems for trading: a mean reversion trade and a continuation style trade ([00:45:24])
  - Mean reversion trade is a cash flow system, while a line trade is more extended.
- Remove things you are not good at or do not like first to quickly figure out one thing ([00:46:06])

- Embrace a long-term perspective in trading, do not stress about immediate success. [00:47:11]
- If personal issues are impacting trading performance, address them before returning to trading. [00:47:17]
- Building a trading model requires self-discovery and understanding one's own approach. [00:47:36]
- Trading is not a game of sharing specific models or strategies; focus on mastering one's own method. [00:47:42]
- Tailor trading ideas to personal preferences and backtest multiple approaches to find what works best. [00:48:35]
- A strategy that doesn't feel right may not be the ideal fit, continue refining until a suitable approach is found. [00:48:40]
- Live trading experience is essential for understanding personal reactions to market conditions. [00:49:10]
- Observing and learning from successful traders can provide valuable insights, but ultimately one's own business plan must be executed. [00:49:56]
- Understand one's own trading plan and become comfortable with potential market fluctuations. [00:50:23]
- Support the success of others while focusing on executing one's own trading strategy. [00:50:30]

- Importance of confidence in trade strategy, derived from experience managing consecutive losses and drawdowns. [00:50:51-00:51:01]
- Emphasis on sticking to one strategy and understanding its nuances. [00:51:28-00:51:34, 00:51:32-00:51:34]
- Discussion on the psychological aspect of trading, particularly fast-paced decision making and risk mitigation. [00:52:01-00:52:37]
- The need for a personalized model or strategy that matches one's personality and strengths. [00:53:27-00:53:37, 00:53:29-00:53:33]
- Mention of the importance of not breaking rules during consecutive loss periods and correct position sizing. [00:51:36-00:51:38, 00:53:39]
- Creation of a boot camp to help individuals identify their strengths and build strategies that suit them. [00:53:42-00:53:45]
- Example given of Twist, who trades the 930 with a low risk profile to match his personal strategy. [00:54:04-00:54:18]
- Final point on the need for understanding and applying personal strategies to succeed in trading. [00:54:37-00:54:39]

Technical terms used: Liquidity, Order Block, RSI, FVG, boot camp, risk profile.

- Time commitment for building a trading plan: It may take months to years, not just two days or a week. ([00:54:39], [00:54:46])
- Importance of testing the plan in various market conditions: Your plan will deteriorate during specific market conditions if it hasn't been properly tested. ([00:55:11], [00:55:18])
- Data collection and understanding: Collecting a sufficient amount of data is crucial for understanding different market conditions, daily conditions, loss periods, and max drawdowns. ([00:55:30], [00:55:37])
- Risk profile building: Build the risk profile behind your plan based on collected data and understanding. ([00:55:39])
- Reviewing and adjusting the plan: Regularly review your plan every quarter or six months to evaluate its performance and make necessary adjustments. ([00:56:24], [00:56:37])
- Avoid quick fixes and changes in strategy: Consistently trading for a short period without testing various market conditions will not yield successful results. ([00:56:40], [00:56:48])
- Embrace the process and accept the time it takes: Peace comes from accepting that building a trading plan takes time, and there may be periods of losses before success is achieved. ([00:57:02], [00:57:06])

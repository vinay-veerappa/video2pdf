# ICT Knowledge Ingestion System — Handover

**Purpose:** Turn heterogeneous ICT trading-education sources (video transcripts,
markdown, PDFs, blogs, chart/diagram images) into a typed, filterable, provenance-
tracked knowledge base that can later feed a trading companion (setup retrieval,
backtest validation, live analysis). Built to capture sources ONCE — provenance
and re-canonicalization mean nothing needs re-ingesting when the vocabulary grows.

This document is the single source of truth for state, architecture, decisions,
and how to run everything. Hand it to any future session to continue.

---

## 1. Current status (as of §19)

**Chart path (v4 — PRODUCTION):** 818/818 images extracted, 0 errors. 
Classification-free `path_is_method` prompt (§18) on gemma4:31b-cloud. Quality 
matches/exceeds Grok reference. All 818 converted to typed KnowledgeUnits 
(setup/framework), validated, in LanceDB at `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb`.

**Text path (ICT-aware — IN PROGRESS):** `--ict-aware` flag (§19a) embeds ICT domain 
knowledge into classify/extract prompts. A/B tested: 2.4x more units, 88% setup 
naming vs 33%. Full TCM corpus re-ingestion running (335 transcripts across 2023-2025).

**Schema (§19b):** Payload required fields made Optional — schema now reflects what 
the extractor actually produces. `None` = not provided; `extraction_confidence` is 
the quality gate.

**Merge + MinerU (§19c-d):** `merge_knowledge_base.py` combines chart + text units 
into unified LanceDB. `mineru_integration.py` routes PDFs through MinerU for 
OCR/layout extraction → images to v4 chart pipeline, text to ICT-aware text pipeline.

**Vocabulary:** 176 canonical concepts (grew 56 → 82 → 172 → 176 across sessions).
Full-corpus unmapped rate: 79% → 37%. Recanonicalize is idempotent — grow vocab 
anytime without re-extraction.

**Deferred by design:** live chart derivation (OHLCV detection code, not pixels); 
trade-journal population (schema built, not yet used); NotebookLM reconciliation 
gate (§10d step 4 — only if low-confidence set justifies it after ICT-aware re-ingest).

---

## 2. Architecture — the whole system in one view

Everything reduces to TWO primitives: **text to extract** and **image to interpret**.
Every source type is a front-stage that feeds one or both.

```
SOURCES                     FRONT STAGE                    CORE PIPELINE

                                                  │
                                            build_lancedb → queryable vector store
```

**Two-channel principle for images:** an image carries meaning in BOTH its text
(labels, notes, conditions) AND its structure (the price path, spatial relations).
The chart extractor must capture both. (This drove the §6 prompt change.)

## 4. Model choices (current — updated by §18/§19)

| Stage | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Segmenter | deepseek-v4-flash:cloud | fast, reliable; used in ICT-aware text pipeline |
| Classifier | deepseek-v4-flash:cloud | same model, batched classify |
| Extractor (text) | deepseek-v4-flash:cloud | best calibration, no hallucination, fast |
| Embeddings | nomic-embed-text | LanceDB vector store |
| Chart VLM (v4) | gemma4:31b-cloud | classification-free, 7/7 accuracy, 818/818 production run |
| Parallel check | qwen3.5:cloud | used for dual-model comparison (educator 99.5% agreement) |

**Chart approach (§18):** Single model (gemma4), classification-free `path_is_method` 
prompt. No multi-model consensus needed when the prompt is good enough. Supersedes 
the §4/§10b kind-dependent model routing and §11b reconciliation gate design.

**Text approach (§19a):** ICT-aware prompts on deepseek-v4-flash:cloud. The generic 
domain-agnostic prompts (§4's original choice) are superseded for ICT corpus.

---

## 5. Key design decisions & rationale

- **Typed knowledge, not prose blobs.** Every unit is one of: setup / contextual /
  framework / tip / psychology / anecdote — each with its own schema. Only `setup`
  and testable `contextual` flow toward backtest validation.
- **Grounding discipline.** Extraction fills only what's stated; inferences go in
  `inferred_fields`; per-unit `extraction_confidence`. This keeps the eventual
  execution layer auditable.
- **Canonical = your dialect.** Vocabulary canonical id is YOUR preferred term;
  every other phrasing (incl. transcription errors like "feg"→fvg, "CISD"→csd) is an
  alias. RULE REFINED in §15a: bare short acronyms were originally banned wholesale
  (over-match risk: "eo"→video, "breaker"→circuit breaker, "smt "→wasmt) — but that
  risk applies to matching against free TEXT. Matching here is actually against
  already-EXTRACTED short concept phrases (raw_concepts), where the risk is much
  lower. Re-added many bare acronyms deliberately (eo, ob, breaker, smt, rr, gap,
  dr) once this was recognized. Re-verify this assumption if a future extractor
  version starts emitting longer free-text concept strings instead of short phrases.
- **Capture once.** Provenance (source_type, image_path, source_page, url) on every
  unit + idempotent recanonicalize = grow vocabulary anytime, never re-ingest.
- **Charts: human-in-the-loop.** VLM proposes structured setup; you verify (it's not
  reliable enough unverified — misreads geometry/levels). No prose output (you have
  the source images). Charts are mostly ILLUSTRATIONS of concepts you already have.
- **Journal is separate.** Your trades ≠ teaching knowledge. Different schema
  (JournalEntry), different store, feeds "review my execution", not concept KB.
- **Two-channel images.** Text + structure both captured (§6).
- **Web JS-charts:** manual save-as-PDF → mixed-PDF route chosen over a headless
  browser dependency. blog_fetch flags JS-rendered charts it can't download.

## 6. Chart-path text-channel fix (SUPERSEDED by §18 — kept for history)

> **§18 superseded this section.** The v4 prompt (classification-free, single 
> model gemma4) solved the chart extraction problem entirely. The multi-model 
> consensus gate (§11) and kind taxonomy (§12-13) are NOT used in production. 
> This section is kept as the reasoning trail that led to §18.

## 7. How to run — full workflow

```
# TEXT SOURCES
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input <transcripts> --output <out>
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input <dir> --output <out> --source-type markdown

# PDFs (text) and mixed PDFs / Google Slides (export Slides as PDF)
python -m knowledge_ingest.sources.pdf_extract --in <pdfs> --out <textout>            # text-only
python -m knowledge_ingest.sources.pdf_extract --in <pdfs> --out <textout> --mixed    # + chart pages
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input <textout> --output <out> --source-type pdf

# BLOGS (image-aware; flags JS-rendered charts)
python -m knowledge_ingest.sources.blog_fetch --url-file urls.txt --out <blogout> --source <key>
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input <blogout> --output <out> --source-type blog

# CHART / DIAGRAM IMAGES  (propose → verify → commit)
python -m knowledge_ingest.sources.chart_extract propose --images <charts> --output <out>
#   ...edit <out>/_review/*.json: fix sequence/relations, set "status":"approved"
python -m knowledge_ingest.sources.chart_extract commit  --output <out>
#   (compare mode to test/choose a VLM: chart_extract compare --images ... --models ...)

# AFTER A BATCH (any source) — grow vocab & build store
python -m knowledge_ingest.report_unmapped  --units <dir1> <dir2> ... --vocab ict --min-count 5
#   ...add worthwhile concepts to vocab/ict_vocabulary.py (your names canonical)
python -m knowledge_ingest.recanonicalize   --units <dir1> <dir2> ... --vocab ict   # dry-run first
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --build-vectors --units <dir1> <dir2> ... --db knowledge.lancedb
```

**Sequencing rules:** do ONE domain (ICT) at a time so vocabularies don't mix; keep
all runs on the SAME vocabulary file; grow vocab once at the end from the full
corpus; re-canonicalize (cheap, idempotent) every time vocab changes; re-EXTRACTION
is never repeated (expensive), only re-canonicalization.

## 9. The bigger roadmap (what this foundation enables)

1. **Knowledge base** (this system) — DONE for text, in-test for charts.
2. **Strategy-candidate registry** — filter setups/testable-contextual units → the
   backtestable idea bank.
3. **Backtest-validation loop** — test candidates against 20y OHLCV + existing
   detection code (Edgeful/FVG) → writes validated stats, flips epistemic_status,
   populates linked_stat_ids. Closes concept→candidate→stat→reasoning loop.
4. **Live chart analysis (Aspect 3)** — derive structure from OHLCV data + detection
   code + KB definitions (reliable) rather than pixels (unreliable). The hard payoff.
5. **Trade journal** — schema exists; populate from journaled charts; feeds companion.
6. **The companion** — reads KB + live data → daily plan, levels, caution score,
   intraday updates. Semi-automated execution is the eventual goal (audit-first).

---

## 10. Post-extraction work queue (MOSTLY DONE — items updated)

> **§18-19 superseded most of this section.** The chart path is now production-ready 
> (818/818 via v4). The text path is being re-ingested with ICT-aware prompts. 
> Remaining open items noted below.

### 10c. text-corpus diagnostics (SUPERSEDED by §19a)
> The 36% below-0.6 confidence and 47% unmapped were from the GENERIC pipeline. 
> ICT-aware prompts (§19a) produce 2.4x more units with 88% setup naming. 
> Re-assess after the ICT-aware re-ingestion completes.

### 10d. Post-extraction sequence (status updated)
1. ~~report_unmapped → grow vocab → recanonicalize~~ **DONE (§15).**
2. ~~Fix extract prompt concept emission~~ **DONE (§15b).**
3. ~~Re-assess low-confidence set~~ **SUPERSEDED by §19a** — ICT-aware prompts change the equation.
4. ~~NotebookLM gate~~ **DEFERRED** — only if low-confidence set justifies it after ICT-aware re-ingest.

---

## 11-13. Chart gate design, taxonomy, labeling sessions (SUPERSEDED by §18)

> **§18 superseded all of this.** The v4 prompt replaced the entire kind taxonomy 
> and multi-model reconciliation gate with a single-model, classification-free 
> `path_is_method` binary judgment. These sections (§11 reconciliation gate design, 
> §12 PDF findings, §13 sequence ambiguity / A-B-C typing / ground-truth labels) 
> are kept in the git history as the reasoning trail that led to §18's breakthrough. 
> 
> Key lessons still valid from §11-13:
> - The taxonomy is NOT closed (every batch found new types) — build with fallback
> - Some "model quality" problems are underspecified prompts, not model gaps (§13a)
> - Text-presence vs geometry-presence is the real distinction for sequence extraction
> - MinerU is the right OCR tool (§17f confirmed) — glm-ocr failed on all test pages


## 14-17. Vocabulary harmonization, code hardening, image/PDF plan (HISTORICAL � condensed)

> These sections document the reasoning trail from the initial text pipeline through
> vocabulary harmonization, code hardening, and the image/PDF bake-off that led to �18.
> Full content is in git history. Key outcomes:

**�14-15: Vocabulary** � 56 ? 82 ? 172 ? 176 canonical concepts across 3 harmonization 
rounds against the full 261-file / 8724-raw-concept corpus. Unmapped rate: 79% ? 37%.
Key insight: matching against short LLM-extracted concept phrases is safe for bare 
acronyms (not the same as matching against free prose text). Kish's 7 Rules fully 
modeled. Two bugs fixed: concepts_raw junk emission (�15b), ChartTextContent 
forward-reference ordering (�15c).

**�16: Code hardening** � 6 bugs fixed, 8 regression tests added (all pass).
Recanonicalize verified safe across full corpus: 11,592 units, 4,483 gained canonical 
ids, 0 regressions. Key fix: map_to_canonical now collects ALL matches per raw 
concept (was breaking after first match).

**�17: Image/PDF plan** � Phase 0 (triage): 600 pages triaged, 91% full-page images.
Phase 1 (VLM bake-off): 55/63 results analyzed, founding premise partially holds 
(71%). MinerU confirmed as OCR tool (glm-ocr failed on all no-text-layer pages). 
MinerU smoke test passed on Flux and MMXM PDFs. GPU acceleration enabled (RTX 4060).
All of this was superseded by �18's classification-free single-model approach and 
�19d's MinerU integration module.

## 18. Session — ICT-aware v4 prompt: classification-free, 7/7 accuracy, full production run

**Date:** session following §17i. This section supersedes §17i's failure and
documents the successful resolution.

### 18a. The breakthrough: drop the kind taxonomy entirely

The §17i failure taught us that ICT domain knowledge in the prompt causes
over-correction on the 4-way `kind` classification (reference_diagram / mixed /
price_path / annotated_chart). User challenged the premise: **"Do we need the
classification if we can interpret the context of the image correctly?"**

The answer was NO. The v4 prompt replaces the entire `kind` taxonomy with a
single binary judgment: **`path_is_method`** — does the drawn path/shape itself
encode the trading method, or is it just a visual reference while text carries
the method? This is the only distinction that matters for downstream extraction:

- `path_is_method=True` → the image IS the setup (schematic, annotated chart with
  markings that ARE the methodology — e.g., Arjo's ST entry model, BSL/DOL
  schematic). Extract the sequence from the drawn path.
- `path_is_method=False` → the image accompanies text (reference diagram, mixed
  text+image where text carries the method — e.g., DailyPo3, ICT Month 10).
  Sequence is 0 or absent.

The A/B/C ground-truth cases map cleanly:
- Case A (reference/text-dominant, seq=0): pim=False
- Case B (price path IS the method, seq≥1): pim=True
- Case C (mixed, seq≥1): pim=True (path contributes to method)

### 18b. v4 results — 7/7 (100%) on gemma4:31b-cloud

| Image | Educator | Framework | pim | seq | Correct? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arjo15m | Arjo | SMR | True | 5 | ✓ |
| BSL_DOL | — | — | True | 6 | ✓ (v3 said mixed — fixed) |
| DailyPo3 | LumiTrader | Po3 | False | 0 | ✓ |
| ICT_Month10 | ICT | — | False | 0 | ✓ (v3 said reference_diagram — fixed) |
| ict_mmxm_notes | MMXM trader | MMXM | True | — | ✓ |
| LRS | — | SMR | True | 8 | ✓ |
| RTH_ORG | — | — | False | 0 | ✓ |

Both v3 failures (BSL_DOL, ICT_Month10) are fixed. Single model (gemma4) achieves
what the 3-model consensus couldn't. **Multi-model consensus is unnecessary when
the prompt is good enough.**

### 18c. Prompt architecture — modular and reusable

The prompt is now in `knowledge_ingest/sources/ict_chart_prompts.py`:

```
ICT_DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE   ← swappable block (15 educators, dialect terms)
                       ← replace with non-ICT domain knowledge for other systems
_V4_EXTRACTION_LOGIC   ← system-agnostic, reusable across domains
ICT_PROPOSE_PROMPT_V4  ← assembled from both
PROMPTS                ← registry dict: {generic, v2, v3, v4}
```

**Design decision:** lean on the model's built-in ICT knowledge for general
concepts (FVG, OB, CSD, liquidity, etc. — the model already knows these). Embed
only **corpus-specific** knowledge: educator profiles and dialect terms that the
model would NOT know from training data. This keeps the prompt lean and avoids
over-prescription.

### 18d. 15 educators profiled in the prompt

ICT, LumiTrader (also publishes MMXM material), Flux, fx4living, MMxM trader,
Afyz, Trader Diego, Hydra, Dexter, TinyVizla, AMTrades, TTrades, Arjo, Kish,
StoicTA.

Each profile includes: known frameworks, terminology dialect, what their charts
typically look like. This lets the model attribute material correctly (e.g.,
MMXM pages → LumiTrader, not a separate "unknown" educator).

---

## 19. Session — ICT-aware text pipeline, schema fix, merge + MinerU integration

**Date:** session following §18d. This section documents the wiring of ICT-aware
prompts into the text pipeline, a schema correctness fix, and the merge/MinerU
integration scaffolding.

### 19a. ICT-aware text prompts — wired into the pipeline

**Problem:** The generic text pipeline prompts (prompts.py) are domain-agnostic.
They don't explain what setup/contextual/framework look like in ICT terms, don't
reference the 176-concept vocabulary, and don't embed ICT framework context (Po3,
MMXM, 7 Rules, sessions, macros). This likely explains the 36% below-0.6
confidence (§10c) and the junk concepts ("analyze 8 o'clock").

**Solution:** `knowledge_ingest/sources/ict_text_prompts.py` provides drop-in
replacements that embed ICT domain knowledge into the classify and extract stages.
Reuses `ICT_DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE` from `ict_chart_prompts.py` (no duplication). Same
JSON output schema — pipeline code works unchanged.

**A/B tested (d14f694):** 3 Kish transcripts, generic vs ICT-aware:
- ICT-aware finds 2.4x more units (31 vs 13)
- Setup naming: 88% (7/8) vs 33% (1/3) — ICT-aware actually names setups
- Better type distribution: 8 setups vs 3, captures tips/psychology
- Concept mapping cleaner: 88% vs 118% (generic over-maps)
- Sample names: 'Bearish Sell-Side Draw', 'CSD short', '4am buy-side raid short'

**Wiring (7bc57d2, 104ff1a):**
- `config.py`: added `ict_aware: bool = False` to PipelineConfig
- `run.py`: added `--ict-aware` CLI flag
- `ingest.py`: `IngestPipeline.__init__` swaps all 6 prompt references based on
  `cfg.ict_aware`:
  - `CLASSIFY_PROMPT` → `ICT_CLASSIFY_PROMPT`
  - `CLASSIFY_SYSTEM` → `ICT_CLASSIFY_SYSTEM`
  - `classify_batch_prompt()` → `ict_classify_batch_prompt()`
  - `EXTRACT_SYSTEM` → `ICT_EXTRACT_SYSTEM`
  - `extract_prompt()` → `ict_extract_prompt()`
  - `extract_batch_prompt()` → `ict_extract_batch_prompt()`
  - Falls back to generic prompts with warning if ict_text_prompts unavailable

**Smoke test:** 7 units from 1 transcript (11th May 2023) — setup, 2 framework,
contextual, 3 tips — all with ICT canonical concepts (FVG, CSD, MSS, killzone).

### 19b. Schema fix — required payload fields → Optional

**Problem:** Several payload classes had required (non-Optional) fields that the
LLM extractor cannot always fill. When the model returned `null` for these fields,
Pydantic v2 rejected the payload, the unit was silently lost, and the top-level
`_payload_matches_knowledge_type` validator failed with a cryptic truncated error.

**Affected fields:**
| Payload | Field | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ContextualPayload` | `event_or_condition` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `ContextualPayload` | `expected_behavior` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `FrameworkPayload` | `method_name` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `FrameworkPayload` | `what_it_answers` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `FrameworkPayload` | `steps` | `List[str]` (default_factory) | `Optional[List[str]] = None` |
| `FrameworkPayload` | `inputs_required` | `List[str]` (default_factory) | `Optional[List[str]] = None` |
| `TipPayload` | `heuristic` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `PsychologyPayload` | `principle` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |
| `SetupStep` | `order` | `int` (required) | `Optional[int] = None` |
| `SetupStep` | `action` | `str` (required) | `Optional[str] = None` |

**Design rationale:** The schema should reflect what the extractor actually
produces. `None` means "not provided" — downstream code can distinguish it from
`""` (empty). The `extraction_confidence` field remains the quality gate. A
brief pipeline-level coercion band-aid (None→"") was tried first but removed —
it masked the real issue and produced misleading data.

**Pipeline error logging also improved:** payload validation failures now print
the payload keys the model returned, and missing payloads are explicitly logged
instead of silently swallowed.

### 19c. Unified LanceDB merge — chart + text knowledge bases

`knowledge_ingest/merge_knowledge_base.py` combines chart-derived units (818 from
v4) and transcript-derived units into a single LanceDB vector store.

**Current knowledge bases:**
- Chart: `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb` (818 rows, table "knowledge")
- Text: will be built from ingest output dirs after transcript re-ingestion completes

**Usage:**
```
python -m knowledge_ingest.merge_knowledge_base --transcript-dir <text_units_dir>
```

**TCM transcript sources (335 total):**
- `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2023\transcripts` — 242 .txt files (raw timestamped)
- `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2024\transcripts` — 75 .txt files
- `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2025\transcripts` — 18 .txt files
- Note: `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\AllTranscripts` has 268 .md files but those are
  summarized/processed versions — NOT the raw verbatim transcripts with timestamps
  that the pipeline expects. The `transcripts_zip/` in the workspace was a partial
  142-file subset of 2023 only.

### 19d. MinerU integration — PDF → image/text routing (FIXED — see §23)

`knowledge_ingest/mineru_integration.py` provides a clean interface to:
1. Run MinerU on a PDF → get markdown + extracted images
2. Route images to v4 chart extraction pipeline
3. Route markdown to ICT-aware text ingestion pipeline

**MinerU venv:** `C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv` (separate Python environment)
**Usage:**
```
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --check
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --pdf <path>
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --pdf-dir <dir> --batch
```

### 19e. How to run the full TCM transcript re-ingestion

Three parallel PowerShell windows (one per year, each writes to separate output
dirs — no collisions since each transcript produces its own `{stem}.jsonl`):

```powershell
# Window 1 — 2023 (242 transcripts)
cd C:\Users\vinay\video2pdf
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input "C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2023\transcripts" --output "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2023" --source-type transcript --ict-aware --no-skip

# Window 2 — 2024 (75 transcripts)
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input "C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2024\transcripts" --output "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2024" --source-type transcript --ict-aware --no-skip

# Window 3 — 2025 (18 transcripts)
python -m knowledge_ingest.run --input "C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2025\transcripts" --output "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2025" --source-type transcript --ict-aware --no-skip
```

After all 3 complete, merge into unified LanceDB (accepts multiple dirs, §23):
```powershell
python -m knowledge_ingest.merge_knowledge_base `
  --transcript-dir "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2023\units" `
                   "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2024\units" `
                   "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_2025\units" `
  --db "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\unified_knowledge.lancedb"
```

### 19f. Testing the knowledge base

**Existing chart LanceDB:** 818 rows at `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb`
(table "knowledge"). Semantic search verified with 5 test queries — all relevant.

**Search API:** `knowledge_ingest.pipeline.vector_store.search()` provides
metadata-filtered semantic search:
- Filter by `knowledge_type` (setup, framework, contextual, tip, psychology)
- Filter by `session` (ny_am, london, etc.)
- Filter by `testability` (backtestable, partially, not_testable)
- Filter by `min_confidence`

**As ingest progresses**, build intermediate LanceDB from partial output and
test retrieval quality against known ICT concepts.

### 19g. Module layout additions (since §3)

- `7bc57d2`: Wire ICT-aware prompts into pipeline + merge/mineru integration
- `104ff1a`: Schema Optional fix + push to GitHub

### 18e. Arjo terminology corrected

The model was producing wrong expansions (OD="Origin of Delivery", FLOD="First
Level of Delivery"). Correct terms embedded directly in the prompt:
- OD = Overlapping Defense (aggressive entry)
- FLOD = First Line of Defense (conservative entry)
- LLOD = Last Line of Defense
- ST = Sharp Turn

Vocabulary updated 172 → 176 concepts (added: sharp_turn, overlapping_defense,
first_line_of_defense, last_line_of_defense).

### 18f. JSON schema additions

- `path_is_method` (boolean) — replaces `kind` (string enum)
- `image_type` (lightweight tag, not a strict taxonomy) — optional context
- `entry_mechanics` (string) — captures entry model details (e.g., "OD Entry:
  aggressive, enters at Overlapping Defense level")
- `educator` and `framework` fields (were in v3, retained in v4)

### 18g. Full production run — IN PROGRESS (parallel sessions)

`knowledge_ingest/tests/run_v4_full.py` — processes all 818 inputs (7 standalone
images + 811 rendered PDF pages from `_triage_renders/`).

**Session 1 (main):**
- Model: `gemma4:31b-cloud`
- Output: `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_full_run\`
- Resume supported (`--resume` flag)
- Progress printed every 10 images with ETA
- ~100-175s per image → ~30-40h total ETA (first image was slowest at 175s)

**Session 2 (parallel, added to cut runtime):**
- Model: `qwen3.5:cloud`
- Output: `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lumitrader\`
- Command: `python run_v4_full.py --model qwen3.5:cloud --resume --filter lumitrader --out-dir "C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lumitrader"`
- Processes the lumitrader book (435 pages) — the biggest remaining chunk
- Separate output dir avoids file conflicts with the main run

**New CLI flags added for parallel support:**
- `--out-dir DIR` — override output directory (for parallel sessions)
- `--filter SUBSTRING` — only process images whose stem/source_pdf contains substring

Both sessions write JSON results + a `_run_log.jsonl` in their respective output
dirs. Results will be merged and deduped at the end (keeping whichever completed
each page first, or comparing both for dual-model coverage on the lumitrader book).

### 18h. Multi-model finding (from test_multimodel_vlm.py)

Before v4's breakthrough, we tested multiple VLMs on the focused problem set:
- **kimi-k2.7-code:cloud** — best at case-B (price_path) detection
- **minimax-m3:cloud + kimi** — best at mixed detection
- But v4 with a single model (gemma4) solved both, making multi-model consensus
  unnecessary. The lever was the prompt, not the model roster.

### 18i. Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `knowledge_ingest/sources/ict_chart_prompts.py` | Central prompt registry (v4 + legacy) |
| `knowledge_ingest/tests/test_prompt_iteration.py` | Single-model test on 7 labeled images |

- Parallel run: qwen3.5:cloud on lumitrader book (435pp), 216.4 min (~3.6h), 0 errors
- Total wall-clock: ~6h (parallel strategy cut runtime in half)

**Full-run statistics (818 valid results):**

| Metric | Value |

| Pages with entry_mechanics | 14 (1.7%) |
| Pages with concepts_raw | 778 (95.1%) |
| Pages with inferred text | 818 (100%) |
| Avg concepts per page | 5.1 |

**Educator distribution (normalized):**
| Educator | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| LumiTrader | 512 | 62.6% |
| unknown | 127 | 15.5% |
| Flux | 74 | 9.0% |

- 811 PDF pages: avg seq=2.0, pim_true=398/811 (49%)

### 18k. v4 vs Grok reference comparison (§17h target quality)

**DailyPo3 — v4 vs Grok:**

| Aspect | Grok (§17h target) | v4 (gemma4) | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Educator | (not asked) | ICT | ✅ correct |
| Framework | Po3 identified | Po3 | ✅ |
| Key concepts | AMD, SMT, CSD, Judas, Po3, PD Array, Premium/Discount | All present: Po3, Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution, PD Array, SMT, CSD, Liquidity Raid, Judas Swing, Premium, Discount | ✅ all 11 concepts captured |
| Bias structure | Identified bullish/bearish columns | "green candle for bullish, black for bearish" | ✅ |
| Depth of explanation | Full contextual explanation | Concise inferred sentence | ⚠️ Shorter but accurate |
| path_is_method | (not asked) | False (reference diagram) | ✅ correct |

**Arjo15m — v4 vs Grok:**

| Aspect | Grok (§17h target) | v4 (gemma4) | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Educator | (not asked) | Arjo | ✅ correct |
| Framework | ST Entry Model | SMR | ✅ (SMR is the broader framework) |
| ST identification | "Sharp Turn (ST) Entry Model" | "ST stands for Sharp Turn" in inferred | ✅ |
| OD Entry | "Origin of Delivery" (Grok was wrong) | "Overlapping Defense - aggressive entry" | ✅ v4 CORRECTED Grok's error |
| FLOD Entry | "First Level of Delivery" (Grok was wrong) | "First Line of Defense - conservative entry" | ✅ v4 CORRECTED Grok's error |
| Trade metrics | R:R 2.0, SL 31.75pts, target 63.50pts | Not captured in structured fields | ⚠️ Missing metrics |
| Entry mechanics | Both entries explained | Both captured with risk_reward field | ✅ |
| Sequence | (not asked) | 5 steps extracted | ✅ bonus |

**Verdict: v4 MATCHES or EXCEEDS Grok quality on the two reference images.**
- v4 correctly identified all key concepts that Grok found
- v4 CORRECTED two Grok errors (OD=Overlapping Defense, not "Origin of Delivery";
  FLOD=First Line of Defense, not "First Level of Delivery") — because the prompt
  embeds the correct Arjo terminology
- v4 produces structured JSON (sequence, entry_mechanics, concepts_raw) vs Grok's
  free-text — better for downstream pipeline ingestion
- v4 is slightly less verbose in the `inferred` field, but trades verbosity for
  structure, which is the right tradeoff for a knowledge base

**Quality assessment across the full run:**
- 95.1% of pages have extracted concepts (avg 5.1 per page) — high coverage
- 100% have inferred text — every page gets interpretation
- 49.3% identified as methodology pages (path_is_method=True) with sequences
- 50.7% identified as reference/non-method pages — correct for text-heavy PDF pages
- Educator identification: 84.5% attributed to a known educator (only 15.5% unknown)
- The 15.5% "unknown" is expected — covers disclaimers, covers, TOC pages, etc.

**Known limitations:**
1. **Entry mechanics only on 14 pages (1.7%)** — the entry_mechanics field is
   rarely populated. Most methodology is captured in `sequence` instead. This is
   a prompt design choice, not a failure.
2. **73 pages (8.9%) have framework=None** — these are pages where the model
   couldn't identify a specific framework. Acceptable for text/cover pages.
3. **Educator name normalization needed** — "Trader Diego" vs "Trader-Diego",
   "MMxM trader" vs "MMxM-trader" — post-processing step required.
4. **No trade metrics (R:R, SL, target)** — v4 doesn't capture numeric trade
   parameters. Could add to prompt v5 if needed.

### 18l. Downstream pipeline — COMPLETE (2026-07-21)

**v4 → KnowledgeUnit converter** (`knowledge_ingest/tests/convert_v4_to_units.py`):
- 818/818 images converted to typed `KnowledgeUnit` JSONL, 0 errors
- `path_is_method=True` → `KnowledgeType.SETUP` (with sequence, entry_mechanics, reference_levels)
- `path_is_method=False` → `KnowledgeType.FRAMEWORK` (reference/text pages)
- Educator names normalized via lookup table
- Concepts mapped via `ict_vocabulary.map_to_canonical()`
- All 818 units validated against `KnowledgeUnit` Pydantic schema
- Output: `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_units\v4_chart_units.jsonl`

**LanceDB vector store** (`C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb`):
- 818 rows embedded with `nomic-embed-text`
- Metadata columns for pre-filtering: `knowledge_type`, `concepts`, `confidence`, `source_file`, etc.
- Semantic search verified with 5 test queries — all returned relevant results
- Search API: `from knowledge_ingest.pipeline.vector_store import search; search(query, db_path=..., k=N)`

**Dual-model comparison** (`knowledge_ingest/tests/_compare_models.py`):
- Educator agreement: 99.5% (433/435)
- `path_is_method` agreement: 64.4% (gemma4 more liberal, qwen3.5 more conservative)
- Framework agreement: 45.3% (qwen3.5 tends to use "other" or "None" where gemma4 assigns specific framework)

**End-to-end pipeline now works:**
```
PDFs/Images → triage_pdf.py → _triage_renders/ (811 PNGs)
                ↓
run_v4_full.py (gemma4:31b-cloud) → _v4_full_run/ (818 JSONs)
                ↓
convert_v4_to_units.py → _v4_units/ (818 KnowledgeUnits)
                ↓
build_lancedb() → _v4_lancedb/ (vector store, 818 rows)
                ↓
search() → semantic retrieval with metadata filters
```

### 18m. Next steps

1. **Text pipeline prompt rewrite (§17i)** — apply ICT-aware approach to
   `prompts.py` for transcripts. Re-classify + re-extract low-confidence subset.
2. **MinerU integration (Phase 5, §17f)** — MinerU for page routing + OCR;
   v4 prompt for interpretation. Full image/PDF pipeline.
3. **Prompt v5 (optional)** — add trade metrics capture, improve entry_mechanics
   frequency, reduce "unknown" educator rate.
4. **Merge chart + text knowledge bases** — combine the 818 chart-derived units
   with the ~300 transcript-derived units into a unified LanceDB.

## 20. Knowledge base query + RAG layer (2026-07-21)

This section documents the three interfaces that connect the knowledge base to any
LLM or client: CLI query, HTTP API server, and Python library. The practical payoff
of the entire pipeline — you ask a question, get a grounded answer with citations.

### 20a. Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ANY LLM or CLIENT                                            │

└──────────┬──────────────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
           │                              │
   ┌───────▼────────┐          ┌──────────▼──────────┐
   │ CLI (ask_kb.py) │          │ API (serve.py)      │

          ┌───────────▼──────────────┐
          │  LanceDB (818+ units)     │
          │  + Ollama LLM (RAG)       │
          └──────────────────────────┘
```

### 20b. Three interfaces

**1. CLI — direct question with LLM synthesis:**
```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.ask_kb "What is the Sharp Turn entry model?"
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.ask_kb "How does Kish use CSD?" --sources --k 5
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.ask_kb "What are the 7 Rules?" --no-llm
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.ask_kb  # interactive REPL
```

**2. HTTP API server — any client can query:**
```powershell
# Start server:
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."
python -m knowledge_ingest.serve --port 8900

# Query from any client:
$body = @{question="What is CSD?"; k=8} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8900/ask" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

# Raw search (no LLM):
$body = @{query="Judas swing"; k=5} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8900/search" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

# Stats:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8900/stats"
```

**3. Python library — for scripts and agents:**
```python
from knowledge_ingest.tests.ask_kb import retrieve, format_context, synthesize
from knowledge_ingest.pipeline.vector_store import search

# Raw search (no LLM):
results = search("CSD order flow", db_path=r"C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb", k=8)

# Full RAG:
results = retrieve("What is CSD?", k=8)
context = format_context(results)
answer = synthesize("What is CSD?", context, model="deepseek-v4-flash:cloud")
```

### 20c. RAG pipeline — how it works

1. **Retrieve:** Question → embedded (nomic-embed-text) → semantic search against
   LanceDB → top-K units with metadata (knowledge_type, confidence, source, speaker)
2. **Format:** Retrieved units formatted as numbered source blocks with concepts,
   payload content, and provenance (who said it, where, when)
3. **Synthesize:** Question + formatted sources → sent to LLM (deepseek-v4-flash:cloud)
   with system prompt: "Answer using ONLY the provided source material. Cite sources
   by number. If sources don't contain enough info, say so."
4. **Answer:** LLM returns grounded answer with [Source N] citations. Every claim
   traces to a specific knowledge unit.

### 20d. API endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check (status + DB path) |
| GET | `/stats` | Database statistics (counts, type distribution, top sources) |
| POST | `/search` | Raw semantic search — returns units, no LLM |
| POST | `/ask` | Full RAG — retrieve + LLM synthesize, returns answer + sources |

**POST /search body:**
```json
{"query": "CSD order flow", "k": 8, "knowledge_type": "setup", "min_confidence": 0.5}
```

**POST /ask body:**
```json
{"question": "What is CSD?", "k": 8, "knowledge_type": null, "min_confidence": 0.5}
```

**POST /ask response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the provided source material, CSD stands for...",
  "question": "What is CSD?",
  "sources": [{"knowledge_type": "setup", "source_file": "Vinay_Models.pdf", ...}]
}
```

### 20e. Query tool — interactive stats and search

`knowledge_ingest/tests/query_kb.py` provides a standalone query tool:

```powershell
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.query_kb --stats
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.query_kb --search "Judas swing" --type setup -k 5
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.query_kb --text-stats
python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.query_kb  # interactive REPL
```

### 20f. Current knowledge base state

**Chart units (LanceDB, ready):** 818 units at `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_lancedb`
- 415 framework, 403 setup
- Sources: LumiTrader book (435), Vinay_Models (119), ICTNotes (78), Flux (67), etc.
- All 0.5-0.9 confidence, avg 5.1 concepts per unit

**Text units (growing):** 62 units from 9 transcripts at `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_text_ict_ingest\units`
- 15 setup, 13 tip, 12 framework, 11 contextual, 10 psychology, 1 anecdote
- Avg confidence 0.79, only 3% below 0.6 (vs 36% with generic prompts)
- All from Kish transcripts; will grow to ~335 transcripts

### 20g. Module layout additions

```
knowledge_ingest/
  serve.py                      NEW: HTTP API server (health, stats, search, ask)
  tests/
    ask_kb.py                   NEW: RAG CLI + interactive REPL
    query_kb.py                  NEW: query tool (stats, search, text-stats, REPL)
```

### 20h. Practical value — what this replaces

| Before (manual) | After (knowledge base) |
|---|---|
| Re-watch 335 videos to find "that thing about the 9:12 macro" | `ask_kb "What is the 9:12 macro?"` |
| Re-explain ICT concepts from memory | LLM answers from KB with citations |
| Manually cross-reference educators' methods | `search "CSD"` across all sources at once |
| No way to verify "did Kish say X?" | Search with speaker filter, see exact transcript + timestamp |
| Can't programmatically access trading knowledge | HTTP API → any tool, bot, or dashboard can query |

### 20i. Connecting to other LLMs

The HTTP API (`serve.py`) makes the knowledge base accessible to:
- **Copilot Chat** — via MCP server or HTTP tool calls
- **Open WebUI** — configure as a custom tool/function
- **Custom agents** — any Python script calls `retrieve()` + `synthesize()`
- **Trading bots** — query setup definitions, framework rules, or session timing
- **Dashboards** — fetch stats and display knowledge coverage

The LLM model used for synthesis is configurable (`--model` flag on serve.py, or
`model` parameter in the Python API). Currently `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` — fast,
grounded, no hallucination. Can be swapped to any Ollama model.

### 20j. KB bridge — connecting to tvdownloadOHLC narrative engine (2026-07-21)

`knowledge_ingest/kb_bridge.py` connects the ICT knowledge base to the
`tvdownloadOHLC` narrative engine. It replaces the static `ICT_CONCEPTS_KB.md`
with dynamic RAG retrieval that matches the day's actual market context.

**Three integration points:**

1. **`get_kb_context_for_narrative(cheat_sheet)`** — scans the narrative cheat
   sheet for ICT concepts (FVG, CSD, MSS, killzone, PDH/PDL, midnight open, etc.),
   retrieves relevant KB units via the API server, formats as a context block
   appended to the cheat sheet. Usage in `briefing_core.py`:
   ```python
   from knowledge_ingest.kb_bridge import get_kb_context_for_narrative
   kb_ctx = get_kb_context_for_narrative(cheat_sheet_text)
   cheat_sheet += "\n" + kb_ctx
   ```

2. **`answer_narrative_question(question)`** — full RAG for interactive narrative
   refinement. Returns grounded answer with source citations.

3. **`verify_narrative_claim(claim)`** — post-narrative fact-checking. Searches
   KB for units related to the claim, returns `{"supported": bool, "sources": [...]}`.

**How it works:** The cheat sheet mentions "FVG below 20030" and "killzone NY AM" →
the bridge detects those concepts → retrieves the LumiTrader FVG setup definition +
the ICTNotes killzone timing reference → appends as context → the narrative LLM now
has grounded definitions matching today's market, with provenance.

**Tested:** Detected 7 concepts in a sample cheat sheet, retrieved 4 relevant KB
units. Requires KB server running (`python -m knowledge_ingest.serve --port 8900`).

**Not yet wired into tvdownloadOHLC** — the bridge module is built and tested,
but `briefing_core.py` hasn't been modified yet. That's the next step when working
in the tvdownloadOHLC repo.

### 20k. Session state at close (2026-07-21)

**In progress (background):**
- TCM transcript re-ingestion with ICT-aware prompts — 3 parallel PowerShell
  windows (2023: 242 files, 2024: 75 files, 2025: 18 files). 9 transcripts
  completed so far (62 text units). Run with `--no-skip` to retry failed files
  after the schema fix (§19b).
- KB API server on port 8900 (may or may not still be running).

**Next steps when resuming:**
1. Check ingest progress: `python -m knowledge_ingest.tests.query_kb --text-stats`
2. If ingest stalled, restart with the commands in §19e (the schema fix is committed)
3. After ingest completes: `python -m knowledge_ingest.merge_knowledge_base --transcript-dir <text_units_dir>`
4. Wire `kb_bridge.py` into `tvdownloadOHLC/scripts/trader/briefing_core.py`
5. Build eval set (20-30 Q&A pairs, §17e) to measure retrieval quality

**Commits this session (beyond §19h):**
- `3d36fa2`: HANDOVER §19 + design_document §7
- `5bfd781`: Clean up HANDOVER (1724→779 lines, removed superseded content)
- `f8821e9`: HANDOVER §20 (RAG/query/API) + serve.py + ask_kb.py + query_kb.py
- `32713c3`: KB bridge (kb_bridge.py — connects to tvdownloadOHLC narrative)

## 21. OPEX validation: vector DB vs NotebookLM (2026-07-21)

Validated that the local LanceDB vector store produces the same OPEX answers
as NotebookLM's synthesis, with **better provenance** at the cost of **less narrative**.

### 21a. The test

Asked both systems the same question: "What does TCM say about OPEX expiry?"

- **NotebookLM** queried the `TCM Notes` notebook (279 sources) via `notebook_query`.
- **Local vector DB** queried 11,206 typed KnowledgeUnits in
  `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2023\ingest_output\units\*.jsonl`, filtered on the canonical
  concept `opex_week` (132 hits: 106 contextual, 11 framework, 7 psychology,
  4 tip, 3 setup, 1 anecdote).

### 21b. Findings

| Concept | NotebookLM | Vector DB |
|---|---|---|
| OpEx = 3rd Friday "Profit Week / Silver Bullet" | yes | yes (conf 0.95) |
| Mon/Tue up -> Wed down template | yes | yes (verbatim anchor, conf 0.8) |
| Options expire worthless -> institutions liquidate | yes | yes (conf 0.9) |
| Wednesday = damage day, news catalyst | yes | yes (conf 0.9) |
| Asia/early London volatility start | yes | yes (conf 0.8) |
| Targets daily liquidity pools | yes | yes (conf 0.95) |
| Sell lasts 2-3 days | no (not explicit) | yes (conf 0.85) |
| H1 focus over LTF noise | no | yes (framework, conf 0.6) |
| Risk only during OpEx | no | yes (tip, conf 0.85) |
| May/June seasonal anomaly | yes (explicit rule) | implied only |
| Profile Zero / Breakaway Gap mechanics | yes (named profile) | tagged, not synthesized |
| Body-to-wick "cruel delivery" rule | yes | not extracted |

**Verdict:** Vector DB confirms NotebookLM's OPEX model and adds granular,
citation-ready facts (verbatim anchors, speaker, session date, timestamp range,
confidence, testable_claim). NotebookLM wins on synthesis (stitches Profile Zero,
Breakaway Gap, body-to-wick into a coherent narrative). Vector DB wins on
precision and backtest-scaffold readiness.

### 21c. Tooling used

- `lancedb 0.34.0` + `pyarrow` installed into `.venv` (was missing)
- `_opex_inspect.py` (workspace root, scratch script) - loads all 2023 units,
  filters on `opex_week`, prints breakdown + framework/setup/tip units + high-
  confidence contextual units. Useful template for future concept validation.
- `build_lancedb` started for `C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\_2023_lancedb` from 11,206
  units (killed mid-embed; re-run when a persistent LanceDB is needed):
  ```powershell
  python -c "from knowledge_ingest.pipeline.vector_store import build_lancedb; build_lancedb(r'C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\2023\ingest_output\units', r'C:\ICT_Videos\TCM\_2023_lancedb')"
  ```

### 21d. Next steps

- Build the persistent LanceDB for 2023 (and 2024/2025 once ingested) so
  `vector_store.search()` works without re-embedding.
- Cross-check 2024 (75) and 2025 (18) transcripts - not yet ingested with
  ICT-aware prompts. Only 2023 (242) is in the units dir.
- Generate backtest-candidate list from the 3 OPEX `setup` units (each has
  `testable_claim` ready for the scaffolder).

## 22. Cross-repo data management (2026-07-21)

This repo (`video2pdf`) is the **producer**: it ingests transcripts, PDFs,
charts -> typed KnowledgeUnits -> LanceDB. The consumer repo
(`tvDownloadOHLC`, `C:\Users\vinay\tvDownloadOHLC`) uses the knowledge base in
its narrative engine (`scripts/trader/briefing_core.py`, `trader_narrative.py`).
Data lives in ONE place; the consumer reads via API.

### 22a. The three places

| Role | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw data (transcripts/PDFs/charts)** | `C:\ICT_Videos\` | `TCM\{2023,2024,2025}\transcripts`, `Testing\_v4_lancedb`, `Testing\_v4_units`, `TCM\2023\ingest_output\units` |
| **Producer repo (this one)** | `C:\Users\vinay\video2pdf` | `knowledge_ingest/` pipeline, `HANDOVER.md` (canonical), `serve.py` KB API |
| **Consumer repo** | `C:\Users\vinay\tvDownloadOHLC` | `scripts/trader/` narrative engine, `kb_bridge.py` consumer |

**Data stays in `C:\ICT_Videos\` and the producer repo.** The consumer repo
does NOT duplicate data - it queries the KB API server (see section 20) or
imports the `knowledge_ingest` package via `kb_bridge.py`.

### 22b. Distribution mechanism (CHOSEN: pointer only)

Per user decision (2026-07-21): **do not copy or submodule the HANDOVER**
into the consumer repo. Instead, the consumer repo's `CLAUDE.md` carries an
absolute-path pointer to this canonical HANDOVER. This keeps one source of
truth and avoids drift.

**Action in tvDownloadOHLC:**
1. Add a context anchor to `C:\Users\vinay\tvDownloadOHLC\CLAUDE.md`:
   ```
   * **Knowledge Ingest Handover (canonical, DO NOT edit here)**:
     [HANDOVER.md](file:///c:/Users/vinay/video2pdf/knowledge_ingest/HANDOVER.md)
     (producer repo: video2pdf/knowledge_ingest; read for KB state, schema,
     LanceDB locations, OPEX section 21 validation, cross-repo data flow section 22)
   ```
2. Add a consumer-facing companion doc at
   `C:\Users\vinay\tvDownloadOHLC\docs\architecture\KB_BRIDGE.md` that summarizes:
   how to start the KB API, how to call it from `briefing_core.py`, the
   `CONCEPT_TRIGGERS` map in `kb_bridge.py`, and the current KB state
   (818 chart units + 11,206 TCM-2023 text units). Scope: what the consumer
   needs to know, not the full producer handover.

**Rules:**
- `HANDOVER.md` is edited ONLY in the producer repo (`video2pdf`).
- If a consumer-repo session needs to update handover state, it edits the
  producer repo and commits there. The consumer doc (`KB_BRIDGE.md`) is the
  consumer-repo-owned summary.
- The KB API (`serve.py`, port 8900) is the runtime contract between the two
  repos. Schema changes to `serve.py` require a corresponding
  `kb_bridge.py` update in the consumer repo.

### 22c. Runtime contract

The consumer repo talks to the producer repo ONLY through:
1. **KB API** (`http://127.0.0.1:8900`): `/ask`, `/search`, `/stats`, `/health`
2. **`kb_bridge.py`** (copy lives in producer; consumer imports or copies):
   - `get_kb_context_for_narrative(cheat_sheet)` -> context block for LLM
   - `answer_narrative_question(question)` -> grounded answer + citations
   - `verify_narrative_claim(claim)` -> supported/unsupported + sources

**Start order:** producer first, then consumer.
```powershell
# 1) Producer: start the KB API server
cd C:\Users\vinay\video2pdf; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."
python -m knowledge_ingest.serve --port 8900

# 2) Consumer: run the narrative engine (any order)
cd C:\Users\vinay\tvDownloadOHLC; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m scripts.trader.trader_narrative --mode premarket --ticker ES1
```

### 22d. What NOT to do

- Do NOT copy transcript PDFs or LanceDB files into the consumer repo.
- Do NOT edit `HANDOVER.md` from the consumer repo - edit it here, the pointer
  in `CLAUDE.md` will pick up the change.
- Do NOT import `knowledge_ingest` as a package from the consumer repo (path
  coupling). Use the HTTP API instead. `kb_bridge.py` is the only piece that
  may be copied across, and even then prefer importing it from the producer
  path via `sys.path.insert(0, r"C:\Users\vinay\video2pdf")`.

### 22e. Open follow-ups

1. Add the `CLAUDE.md` pointer + `docs/architecture/KB_BRIDGE.md` to the
   consumer repo (next session in tvDownloadOHLC).
2. Wire `kb_bridge.get_kb_context_for_narrative()` into
   `briefing_core.build_trader_cheat_sheet()` (the actual integration the
   bridge was built for).
3. Build eval set (20-30 Q&A pairs) covering OPEX, CSD, killzones, 7 Rules -
   to measure retrieval quality before/after the bridge is wired in.

## 23. Session — Unified LanceDB built; MinerU integration fixed (2026-07-23)

**Date:** session following section 22. This section documents the unified LanceDB
merge (chart + text + PDF units), the MinerU integration bugs that were found
and fixed, and the TWO paths for PDF processing.

### 23a. Unified LanceDB — COMPLETED

`merge_knowledge_base.py` was updated to accept multiple `--transcript-dir` args
(`nargs="+"`). Successfully merged all chart + text + PDF units into one LanceDB.

**See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and [README.md](README.md) for commands.**

**DB:** `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\unified_knowledge.lancedb` (table `knowledge`)
**Total units:** 4,168 (re-merged after richer PDF extraction)

| knowledge_type | count |
|---|---:|
| framework | 1,662 |
| setup | 904 |
| contextual | 703 |
| tip | 510 |
| psychology | 370 |
| anecdote | 19 |

**Sources merged (4 dirs, 0 collisions):**
- 818 chart units: `C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\_v4_units\v4_chart_units.jsonl`
- 3,327 transcript units: `_text_ict_ingest\units` (317 .jsonl) + `_text_ict_2025\units` (37 .jsonl)
- 23 PDF text units: `_text_ict_pdf_tcm\units` (2 .jsonl — from MinerU+ICT-aware text ingest)

**Known gap:** `source_type` column is empty in LanceDB — `vector_store.py`
`build_lancedb()` doesn't surface `source_type` as a top-level column (it's
nested in `full_json`). To filter by chart-vs-transcript origin, add
`source_type` to the record dict in `build_lancedb`. (See DESIGN.md section 6.)

### 23b. TWO PDF processing paths — choose by content type

There are two distinct workflows for PDFs, chosen by content type:

**Path A — Chart/image-heavy PDFs (Lumi book, Flux NY Guide, MMXM, Vinay_Models):**
These were processed as CHART IMAGES via the v4 chart pipeline. The ICT-aware
improvement that enabled this was the v4 CHART prompt (section 18), NOT the text pipeline.
  1. `triage_pdf.py --pdfs <pdfs> --render` → renders each page to PNG in `_triage_renders/`
  2. `run_v4_full.py` → v4 chart extraction (gemma4 ICT-aware prompt) on each PNG
  3. `convert_v4_to_units.py` → converts to KnowledgeUnit JSONL → `_v4_units/v4_chart_units.jsonl`
  4. This produced the 818 chart units already in the unified LanceDB.
  - Lumi book: 435 pages, Flux NY Guide: 67 pages, MMXM, Vinay_Models (119), ICTNotes (78)
  - Triage routes text-dominant pages to text pipeline for free; only image pages need VLM.

**Path B — Text-heavy PDFs (Trader Blue Print Series, You Tube notes):**
Use `mineru_integration.py` → MinerU extracts text → ICT-aware text pipeline.
This is the path for text-heavy PDFs (fixed this session, section 23c).
  - Trader Blue Print Series: 8 text units, 39 chart images (for later v4)
  - You Tube notes: 0 text units, 38 chart images (image-heavy → needs v4 path A)

**Choosing the right path:**
- PDF mostly chart screenshots/diagrams → Path A (triage + render + v4)
- PDF mostly text/notes → Path B (MinerU + text ingest)
- Mixed → Path A handles both: triage routes text pages to text pipeline,
  image pages to v4. MinerU is the alternative text extractor when poppler is missing.

### 23c. MinerU integration — bugs found and FIXED

`mineru_integration.py` (written during section 19d) had 5 bugs that prevented it from
running. All fixed this session:

**Bug 1 (FIXED) — wrong package name in `check_mineru()`:**
- Was: `import magic_pdf` (the OLD package name)
- Now: `import mineru` (v3.4.4 — package was renamed) + verify `mineru.exe` exists

**Bug 2 (FIXED) — wrong CLI invocation in `run_mineru()`:**
- Was: `python -m magic_pdf.cli -p ... -o ... -m auto`
- Now: `C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv\Scripts\mineru.exe -p ... -o ... -m auto -b hybrid-engine`

**Bug 3 (FIXED) — wrong output path expectation in `run_mineru()`:**
- Was: `<output>/<name>/auto/<name>.md`
- Now: `<output>/<name>/hybrid_auto/<name>.md` (with `auto/` + glob fallback)

**Bug 4 (FIXED) — was only half a pipeline (design gap):**
- Was: `process_pdf()` only extracted + PRINTED "next steps" commands
- Now: `process_pdf()` with `--run-text` (default True) ACTUALLY executes the
  ICT-aware text ingest via IngestPipeline (not just prints it).
- Single command does: MinerU extract → stage .txt → run text ingest

**Bug 5 (NOT fixed — low priority) — `pdf_extract.py` broken:**
- `pdf_extract.py` relies on poppler-utils (`pdftotext`, `pdfimages`, `pdftoppm`, etc.)
- None installed on PATH; pdfplumber fallback also not installed.
- Superseded by MinerU (Path B) and triage+render (Path A). Don't use pdf_extract.py.

### 23d. MinerU environment — correct setup (verified this session)

- **Venv:** `C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv` (Python 3.12.10 — MinerU requires 3.10+)
- **Package:** `mineru` v3.4.4 (NOT `magic_pdf` — that's the old name)
- **CLI:** `C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv\Scripts\mineru.exe`
- **Ingest venv:** `C:\Users\vinay\video2pdf\.venv` (separate — holds lancedb, pydantic, ollama client, requests)
- **NEVER cross the two venvs** — MinerU pulls torch/paddle/vlm engines that conflict with the ingest deps

**Working MinerU CLI (verified against prior successful runs):**
```
C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv\Scripts\mineru.exe -p <pdf_path> -o <output_dir> -m auto -b hybrid-engine
```
Output layout: `<output_dir>/<pdf_stem>/hybrid_auto/<pdf_stem>.md` + `images/*.png`

**Usage (after fixes):**
```
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --pdf <path>
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --pdf-dir <dir> --batch
python -m knowledge_ingest.mineru_integration --check
```
Add `--no-text` to only do MinerU extraction (skip text ingest).
Add `--text-output <dir>` to override ingest output dir.

### 23e. End-to-end verification (this session)

Both new PDFs processed successfully via the fixed integration:
- `Trader Blue Print Series.pdf`: MinerU 93s → 39 images → 8 text units (framework×4, tip×4)
- `You Tube notes.pdf`: MinerU 45s → 38 images → 0 text units (image-heavy; needs v4 path A)

Unified LanceDB rebuilt with all 4 dirs: 4,153 units total.

### 23f. Remaining gaps

1. **`source_type` column in LanceDB** — still empty; add to `build_lancedb` records
   so queries can filter by chart-vs-transcript-vs-pdf origin.
2. **File-type auto-detection in `run.py`** — not implemented. Currently you must
   choose Path A (triage+render+v4) or Path B (mineru_integration) manually.
   The "point at a directory and it handles everything" goal would require `run.py`
   to detect .pdf/.png/.txt and auto-route.
3. **Chart images from MinerU** — staged in `_mineru_images` but NOT auto-extracted
   (intentional — v4 is human-in-the-loop: propose → review → commit).
4. **`pdf_extract.py`** — broken (no poppler); superseded by the two paths above.

### 23g. Prior successful MinerU outputs (before integration fix)

- `_mineru_out/Flux_NY_Guide/hybrid_auto/Flux_NY_Guide.md` + 4 images
- `_mineru_out/MMXM/hybrid_auto/MMXM.md` + 6 images
- `_mineru_img_test/` — 7 v4 ground-truth cases (Arjo15mSTEntryModel, BSL_DOL, DailyPo3,
  ict_mmxm_notes, ICT_Month10IndexTradeSetups, LRS, RTH ORG Repricing Model Bias)

### 23h. Design doc + documentation sync (this session)

Created `DESIGN.md` — the canonical architecture/goals/roadmap document. Covers:
- 3-layer architecture (Ingestion -> Knowledge Base -> Strategy/Execution)
- Design decisions (domain-specific ingestion, runtime confluence, free-text
  payloads + structured candidates, producer/consumer split)
- Planned Layer 3: Strategy Candidate Registry, Confluence Engine, Backtest
  Validation Loop, Automated Trading
- 6-phase roadmap

Synced all documentation:
- `DESIGN.md` (NEW) — architecture, goals, design decisions, roadmap, file layout
- `README.md` (UPDATED) — current commands (MinerU, ICT-aware, two PDF paths, query)
- `sources/INPUTS.md` (UPDATED) — two PDF paths (MinerU + triage), removed broken pdf_extract.py refs
- `HANDOVER.md` (UPDATED) — section 23 (this session), links to DESIGN.md

Document map (from DESIGN.md header):
| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| DESIGN.md | Architecture & goals (read first) |
| README.md | How to run (commands) |
| INPUTS.md | How to feed sources (routing) |
| HANDOVER.md | Session state log |
| VOCABULARY_REVIEW.md | Vocab decisions |### 23i. Phase 1 foundation fixes — DONE (2026-07-23)

Phase 1 from the DESIGN.md roadmap is complete and committed (eff53f1):

1. **source_type column in LanceDB** — added to vector_store.py build_lancedb()
   records + source_type filter in search(). Verified: transcript(3327),
   diagram(811), pdf(23), chart(7). Queries can now filter by origin.

2. **serve.py default DB** — changed from _v4_lancedb (chart-only) to
   unified_knowledge.lancedb (all 4168 units).

3. **domains field in schema** — added to KnowledgeMetadata (default ["ict"]).
   Allows tagging units by domain; confluence units can be ["ict","gex"].

4. **--ict-aware/--no-ict-aware flag** — added to mineru_integration.py so the
   prompt choice is explicit (was hardcoded True).

Tests: 8 regression tests pass + 5 Phase 1 verification tests pass.

### 23j. CHECKPOINT — session end state (2026-07-23)

**Git state:** committed and pushed to GitHub (origin/main at eff53f1)
- 8b93e80: DESIGN.md + MinerU fix + doc sync
- eff53f1: Phase 1 foundation fixes

**Knowledge base:**
- DB: C:\ICT_Videos\Testing\unified_knowledge.lancedb
- 4,168 units (818 chart + 3,327 transcript + 23 PDF)
- source_type column populated and verified
- domains field in schema (default ["ict"])

**Documentation (all in sync):**
- DESIGN.md — architecture, goals, roadmap (read first for next session)
- README.md — commands (MinerU, ICT-aware, two PDF paths, query)
- INPUTS.md — source routing (MinerU + triage, removed broken refs)
- HANDOVER.md — this file (session log through section 23)

**Code changes committed:**
- mineru_integration.py — 5 bugs fixed (magic_pdf->mineru, CLI->mineru.exe,
  auto->hybrid_auto, execute text ingest, --ict-aware flag)
- merge_knowledge_base.py — multiple --transcript-dir dirs (nargs="+")
- vector_store.py — source_type column + filter
- serve.py — default DB -> unified_knowledge.lancedb
- schema/models.py — domains field in KnowledgeMetadata

**Next session should start with:**
1. Read DESIGN.md section 9 (roadmap) — Phase 2 is next
2. Phase 2: prompt profile registry (domains/registry.py + --profile ict+gex)
3. Then Phase 3: strategy candidate registry (KB setups -> executable candidates)

**MinerU reminder:** lives in C:\Users\vinay\mineru_venv (Python 3.12.10,
mineru v3.4.4). CLI is mineru.exe, NOT the old magic_pdf. See HANDOVER section 23d.
